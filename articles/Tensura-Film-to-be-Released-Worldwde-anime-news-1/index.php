                            [Comments]
                            “Make Me Feel Better” is a song about strong connections with one's friends, so the lyrics and melody have a very cheerful and hopeful atmosphere.<br/><br/>I sang the song thinking about the happiness that you share with friends after overcoming hardships together. I think “hikari no mukou” (beyond the light) is a keyword in this song. I repeat it several times, but in slightly different ways.
                            
                            The main theme of the song is “bonds with friends,” which refers to the links between Rimuru and his friends in Tempest and between Hiiro and Benimaru, and the feeling that you can overcome anything for the sake of your loved ones.
                            
                            I'd also like you to pay attention to the lyrics “Thinking of you, I got myself back.” During the movie, there's a scene where Hiiro remembers his old friends, so after watching it, I'd like you to listen to the song again and think about those lyrics. I think this movie takes place on a much larger scale than the anime, so I'm really excited. I can't wait to see it in the theater!

                            MindaRyn hails from Thailand. Wanting to become more serious about her dream of becoming an anime singer, she started uploading anisong cover videos on YouTube.<br/><br/>This led to her being discovered by Lantis, under whom she made her artist debut in 2020 singing “BLUE ROSE knows,” the ending theme song of the anime By the Grace of the Gods. Following her debut, she sang numerous theme songs for other anime including That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Season 2: Part 2 and the second season of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest.<br/><br/>Currently, her YouTube channel has more than one million subscribers and her videos have surpassed one hundred million views. In December 2022 her first album, My Journey, is scheduled to be released and contains “Make Me Feel Better,” the theme song for Scarlet Bond.
